# Uber-Fare-Prediction
The primary goal of the project is to create an algorithm that will determine the fare that should be charged to a passenger. A regression model is created using machine learning methods.

Problem Statement: The study focuses on Uber Inc., the biggest taxi firm in the world. Our goal in these projects is to forecast the cost of their upcoming transactional cases. Additionally, this business provides services to thousands of clients every day. Effective data management is now crucial for developing new business concepts and achieving the greatest outcomes.
So, it becomes really important to estimate the fare prices accurately.
